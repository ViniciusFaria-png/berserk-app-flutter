<h2 id="started">üìå About</h2>

Berserk Clicker is a Flutter-based incremental game inspired by the classic "cookie clicker" genre, bringing the dark fantasy world of Berserk to mobile devices.
Players tap in the Behelit to gain Souls that 're used to buy power-ups. As they progress, players unlock iconic Berserk-themed upgrades, boosting their tap. With a minimalistic UI and smooth animations, the game offers a immersive experience for fans of the franchise and clicker games alike.
